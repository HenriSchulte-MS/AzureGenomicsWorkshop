1. In order to complete this workshop on Azure you need to have a Microsoft Account (E.g. outlook, live, hotmail). You should not use your organizational credentials, as it might not work properly.

2. For this workshop we are providing you with an Azure Pass, which is a time limited credit to use Azure services. We will provide you with a promo code for the workshop. The passes can be redeemed by following the process here: https://www.microsoftazurepass.com/Home/HowTo?Length=5.
